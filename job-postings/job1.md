We are looking for a Junior Software Engineer in Australia to join our remote-first development team. You will work with other software engineers in our supportive, high-performance team on product development of our market leading business software, used by major FMCG companies in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Founded in 2002, we have established ourselves as the market leader for our niche in Australia and NZ, and we're steadily growing our team as our client base grows.

Our engineering team is fully remote, working from home though we meet up at least once a year to connect as a team. We also have a set of remote-first perks for home office setup, personal learning and health & wellbeing, and we maintain a longstanding commitment to sensible work hours and a strong team focus on learning and improvement.



Our ideal candidate has the following attributes

You recently graduated from a tertiary qualification in software engineering or computer science (or have equivalent real-world experience).

You have growing experience in software development using languages and technologies such as C#, TypeScript, .NET, Angular and/or SQL Server.

You have a growing understanding of software development and design principles and a desire to continually learn more.

You aspire to be a software craftsman who understands and applies best practices for software design to write high-quality code and manage technical debt over time.

You have excellent troubleshooting and problem-solving skills and are excited by solving challenging problems and learning new technologies.

You are a team player who enjoys working collaboratively with others and is able to engage in constructive conflict.

You are self-motivated, work well independently, pay attention to detail and love to excel in your work, always striving to improve.

Although this role is fully remote, to be considered you must reside in Sydney, Central Coast, Newcastle, Gold Coast, Brisbane or Canberra.



If you are interested, please apply with your resume, and a cover letter that meets the following requirements:

First page: A short letter addressed to "Brenton" outlining why you think this role would be a good fit for you, written by you, not an AI.

Second page(s): Your university transcript (or if you do not have one, an outline of your relevant real world experience)

Given the high volume of applications, if the above information is missing, or you do not fit the location criteria, you may not receive a response.
